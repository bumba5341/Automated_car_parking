# Automated_car_parking

Here I Implemented automated car parking system using arduino. 

Sensor used : a) PIR - for detecting the motion of car.
              b) LDR - for detecting the intensity of light.
              
 I use a green led to understand availibility of parking and a red led use to understand parking is full.
 when the car sufficient near the parking the gate is automically open . 
 
 when the intensity of light is decrease , measered by ldr sensor ,  the light in parking automically lighted. when it is day the light is automacilly switched  off. No man power use in this case.
